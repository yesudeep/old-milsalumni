        <blockquote>It took 7 colors and a million raindrops to make that picture, we call a rainbow.</blockquote>
        <h2>United we stand.  Divided we're history.</h2>
        <p>We come from different areas of the industry, play different roles at work, belong to diverse age groups, even graduated in different years, but there's one thing that unites us: our institute.</p>
        <p>Tremendous amount of energy, time and effort has gone into bringing about a reunion through this Website.</p>
        <blockquote>So, stick around&mdash;you're the rainbow.</blockquote>
